        subtitle: "by Tanmay Kalbande",
        date: "September 11, 2025",
        project: "Pustakam",
        snippet: "I'll be honest Pustakam exists because I'm terrible at following through on learning projects. Picture this: I'd get excited about learning... I'd have three browser tabs still open, half-watched videos, and exactly zero understanding. Sound familiar?",
        content: `![Pustakam Analytics Dashboard](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/continentalstorage888-ops/didactic-meme@main/Screenshot%202025-10-30%20at%2021-57-41%20Pustakam%20AI%20Book%20Generation%20Engine.png)

### The Problem
I'm terrible at following through on learning projects. I'd get excited about a new topic, bookmark fifteen articles, queue up six tutorials, and download two PDFs. Three weeks later, I'd have scattered resources, half-watched videos, and zero actual understanding. The problem wasn't a lack of information, but that it was inconsistent, aimed at different audiences, and lacked a cohesive structure. I needed a single, perfectly tailored book for what I wanted to learn.

### My Approach
I had a simple realization: what if I could make an AI write that book? Not just a single ChatGPT dump, but a structured, coherent book with chapters that build on each other, a logical table of contents, and consistency from start to finish. This led to the creation of Pustakam, an AI-powered book generation engine.

### Challenges Faced
My initial plan to "just ask GPT to write a book" failed spectacularly. The output was a rambling, repetitive mess. The real challenge was maintaining context and consistency across multiple, sequential API calls. Generating a full book in one go overwhelmed the AI, but breaking it up lost the thread between chapters.

Another significant challenge was managing the UI state during a long, sequential generation process. The app needed to show progress, handle errors, and remain responsive for several minutes while generating a roadmap, 8+ chapters, and supplementary content. TypeScript was crucial for managing this complexity.

### Solution Architecture
After many failed attempts, I developed a four-step process that worked:
1.  **Define the Scope:** The user specifies not just the topic, but the target audience and assumed prior knowledge.
2.  **AI Proposes a Roadmap:** The AI first generates a detailed outline (table of contents). This allows the user to validate the structure before committing to a full generation.
3.  **Sequential Generation with Memory:** This was the breakthrough. When generating a chapter, the AI is fed a summary of the preceding chapters. This "memory" ensures context is maintained.
4.  **Final Polish:** The AI writes an introduction, conclusion, and glossary based on the complete, generated content, which is then stitched into clean Markdown.

For the tech stack, I prioritized privacy and flexibility. The app is **local-first**, with all data and API keys stored in the browser's local storage. This eliminates server costs and privacy concerns. It also supports **multiple AI models** (Gemini, Mistral, ZhipuAI), allowing users to choose the best tool for their topic and budget.

### Results & Impact
Pustakam successfully transforms a user prompt into a structured, downloadable book. Key features I'm proud of include:
-   **The Analytics Dashboard:** After generation, the app provides metrics like reading time, complexity score, and topic breakdown, making the output feel more tangible.
-   **A Polished Reading Experience:** I invested significant time in typography and spacing to ensure the digital output felt like a real book.
-   **Clean Markdown Export:** The final book is exported in a universal, non-proprietary format, giving the user full ownership.

While Pustakam won't replace expert-written literature, it serves as a powerful tool for rapidly generating a structured learning resource on a specific topic, solving the initial problem of scattered and inconsistent information.

        title: "Why I Built My Own AI Tutor Instead of Using ChatGPT",
        subtitle: "by Tanmay Kalbande",
        date: "October 19, 2025",
        project: "Ai-Tutor",
        snippet: "I built Ai-Tutor because I was already obsessed with Gemma and wanted an excuse to use it more. Here's what my study sessions looked like: one AI chat open for explanations. Another tab for generating practice questions. My notes app buried somewhere.",
        content: `![Ai-Tutor Welcome Screen](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/continentalstorage888-ops/didactic-meme@main/ai-tutot-welcome-screen.png)

### The Problem
My study workflow was chaos. I'd have one AI chat open for explanations, another for generating practice questions, my notes app buried somewhere, and a dozen other browser tabs I'd opened days ago. By the end of a session, I'd have useful information scattered everywhere with no cohesive structure. The tools were fine, but the process was inefficient and disorganized. I needed a single, integrated environment to chat, generate quizzes, take notes, and visualize my learning journey.

### My Approach
I decided to build a unified learning platform centered around Google's Gemma model, which I found to be exceptionally clear and effective for tutoring. The goal was to create a clean, clutter-free interface where a user could pick an AI persona and have all their learning tools in one place. This became Ai-Tutor, a project I built over four weeks of nights and weekends.

### Challenges Faced
The most difficult feature to implement was the **learning flowchart**. The initial idea was to visualize the conversation as a mind map. My first attempts produced messy, unreadable diagrams with too many nodes and confusing connections. My second attempt to improve the prompt was better but still resulted in a static, non-interactive SVG.

The breakthrough came when I realized the flowchart wasn't for documentation, but for reflection. I rebuilt it from scratch to have the AI analyze the conversation and produce a structured learning map of only the key concepts and their relationships. I then used an interactive canvas that supported zooming and panning, which finally made the feature useful.

### Solution Architecture
Ai-Tutor is built on several core features designed to create a personalized and effective learning environment:
-   **Gemma-centric Design:** The app is foundationally built to leverage the strengths of Google's Gemma model, with Mistral and ZhipuAI available as alternatives.
-   **AI Personas:** Users can choose from four distinct personas (Friendly Mentor, Exam Coach, etc.). This allows the user to match the AI's teaching style to their current learning mood, which has a significant impact on the experience.
-   **Context-Aware Quizzes:** Instead of generic questions, the quiz feature analyzes the entire conversation history to generate questions specifically about the concepts the user has been learning and struggling with.
-   **Interactive Learning Flowchart:** Visualizes the user's conversation as an interactive knowledge map, showing how questions and concepts connect.
-   **Local-First Persistence:** All conversations and notes are saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring privacy and instant loading.

### Results & Impact
Ai-Tutor successfully consolidates a scattered learning workflow into a single, cohesive application.
-   The persona system proved to be a genuinely useful feature, not just a gimmick.
-   Context-aware quizzes provide a much more effective way to test retention compared to generic quiz generators.
-   The interactive flowchart, despite its challenges, offers a unique way for users to reflect on and understand the structure of what they've learned.

The project reinforced that for AI applications, the user experience and workflow design are just as important as the underlying model. It's a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be installed like a native app.
